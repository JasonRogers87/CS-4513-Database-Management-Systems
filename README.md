# Database Management Systems

These are my notes for the Database Management Systems (CS 4513) course taught by Dr. Le Gruenwald during the
Fall 2019 semester at the University of Oklahoma.
These notes were taken directly from selected chapters of the textbook, _Database System Concepts 7th ed._ by Silberschatz, Korth, and Sudarshan,
and paraphrased by me. Some chapters and sections were omitted because they were not covered in class.
