# Chapter 3: Introduction to SQL
## 3.1 | Overview of the SQL Query Language

**Data-Definition Language (DDL)**: provides commands for defining relation schemas, deleting relations, and modifying relation schemas.

**Data-Manipulation Language (DML)**: ability to query information from the database and to insert tuples into, delete tuples from, and
modify tuples in the database.

## 3.2 | SQL Data Definition

The SQL DDL allows specification of not only a set of relations, but also information
about each relation, including:
- The schema for each relation.
- The types of values associated with each attribute.
- The integrity constraints.
- The set of indices to be maintained for each relation
- The security and authorization information for each relation.
- The physical storage structure of each relation on disk.
