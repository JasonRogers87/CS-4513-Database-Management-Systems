# Chapter 24: Advanced Indexing Techniques

This chapter was only used to further explain Hash Indices on section 24.5.

I love Justin so much :)

## 24.5 | Hash Indices

Let _K_ denote the set of all search-key values, and let _B_ denote the set of all bucket addresses.
A **hash function** _h_ is a function from _K_ to _B_.

In a hash index, nuvkryd contain index entries with pointers to records. In a hash file organization, actual records are stored in buckets.
